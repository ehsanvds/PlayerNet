Popularize your game

## Background
The market of video game industry is growing. In any gaming platform, itâ€™s important for game developers to make their new game popular.
The result of this project is for marketing team of game developers to make a new game popular by suggesting it to the right video game players.

## Problem
So, in a gaming platform, I want to identify users based on their interest to a specific genre, their playing time, and more importantly,
whether they have a lot of friends who are also interested in that genre. So, a game developer offers a new game to a right player
and when the friends of the player are also interested in the game, it become popular more quickly.

## Data
The data I worked with is from Steam gaming platform, and it was gathered by [Intenet Reseach Laboratory](https://steam.internet.byu.edu/ "Steam Dataset")
in format of MySQL database for 109 million users. I had profile data of players, their games, their playing time, and their list of 
friends. Also, games data were available that I used game genre. I focused on 2.6 million players in Canada with their friend connections 
in other countries.
